<h4 align="left">E.T.S stands for End To Stress which was our Major Project for the freshman course PIS(Prototyping Interactive Systems). This Project includes a smart glass where Arduino MINI acts as the brain of the glasses and laser cutting technique was used to design its frame. The wearable has a heart rate monitoring sensor attached to it and 0.75in OLED display which displayes the heart rate of the person when the finger is placed in the sensor. Next, a POV(persistence of Vision) display was developed from scratch using Arduino MINI ,LEDS and a 3-D printed frame encasing all these materials. The display rotates with the help of a high RPM DC motor which wen rotated at a certain speed, displayes the desired message to be displayed.</h4>
